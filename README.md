2 day of work to get the setup running.
Here is the result:

Actually quite decent for a simple setup like this. Nice colors and almost 0 flicker.
The projector speed adjustment has a nice range and very easy to get close to 0 flicker.
Here is the comparison Hawkeye

Obviously Hawkeye is quite a bit more money and more work to setup and much longer scan time...

Replaced the ELP lens that came with the camera with the Imaging Source 12mm lens and the results are much better.

Download the video because playing it from google drive is poor quality.
This was scanned at 5 frames per second and then run through getdups.avs Avisynth script. The script removed all transitions one 100%.
I used AMCap for capture and set the Sankyo projector to the minimum speed which runs just slightly higher than 5 FPS.
Did the getdups script and then horizontal flip and crop and that is about it.
If you already own a Sankyo projector this will cost you <$100.
It may be possible to do this mod with other brands if the front opening is wide enough.

A few downsides:
- The rez is a bit on a low side like 900x700 final crop but in my opinion that is fully acceptable for a medium quality film.
- AMCap capture sw has preview issues. The preview gets all garbled up but that does not impact the saved video. I tried several capture apps
but they all have some issues so I stayed with AMCap.

Will try to post the instructions in github within a few days.
